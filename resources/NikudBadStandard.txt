עִיקָר קִדוּשָׁא בְּלַיְלָה הוּא קָדִישׁ - The main "sanctification" is at night, דְכִי קָדִישׁ - for when one "sanctifies" - תְּחִלַת יוֹמָא בָּעִי לְקִידוּשִׁי - [it is] the beginning of the day [that] he must "sanctify"! הָכִי קָאָמַר - [So we must understand that] he [i.e. the Tanna of our (above-quoted) Baraisa (Rashbamº)] meant to say: "זָכוֹר אֶת יוֹם הַשַׁבָּת לְקַדְשׁוֹ" - [The pasuk* says (Sh'mos 20:8):] "Remember the Shabbos day, to sanctify it," זוֹכְרֵהוּ עַל הַיַיִן בְּכְּנִיסָתוֹ - [i.e.] "remember it" [i.e. make mention of the Shabbos] over wine, when it arrives.
The Gemara (Nazir 3b3) [standard text of our edition]: וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן נַמִי - And [as for] R' Shimon as well: הָכְּתִיב - what about the fact that it is written (Bamidbar 6:3), "מִיַיִן וְשֵׁכָר יַזִיר" - "he [i.e. a nazir*] shall abstain from wine and intoxicating [drinks]"! [I.e. and therefore shouldn't R' Shimon have to agree that there is such a thing as becoming a nazir even when accepting only the drinks as assur?] הַהוּא מִיבָּעִי לֵיה - To him, that [extra phrase (Tosafosº)] was necessary - לֶאֱסוֹר יַיִן מִצְוָה כְּיַיִן הָרְשׁוּת - [in order] to [teach that] Mitzvah wine is [just as] assur [for a nazir] as optional wine. מַאי הִיא - What is that [phrase "Mitzvah wine" referring to]? קִדוּשְׁתָּא וְאַבְדַלְתָּא - [that of] kiddush or havdalah?! [4a] הַרֵי מוּשְׁבַּע וְעוֹמֵד עָלָיו מֵהַר סִינַי - [but] after all, he already stands sworn [in the matter] from Mount Sinai! [This is explained by Tosafos, cited below.] אֶלָא כִּי הָא דְאָמַר רָבָא - Rather, [the meaning is] like that which Rava said: "שְׁבוּעָה שֶׁאֶשְׁתֶּה" - [If a person said,] "[I hereby take] a shevu'ah* oath that I will drink [wine today (Rambam)]," וְחָזַר וְאָמַר "הַרֵינִי נָזִיר" - and [then] he proceeded to say, "[I] hereby [declare that as of now] I am a nazir," אַתְיָא נְזִירוּת חַיְילָא עַל שְׁבוּעָה - [the result is that] the [new status of] being a nazir "comes and rests upon" [i.e. becomes applicable in addition to] the shevu'ah oath [i.e. it now becomes assur for him to drink wine even though at the time he declared himself a nazir it had been a Mitzvah for him to drink wine (Rambam)].
Tosafosº (ibid.): וְקָשֶׁה - [However,] this [version of the text] is difficult: דְאַדְרַבָּה - (For) [why is it a problem if we say that one "already stands sworn" regarding kiddush?] - just the opposite! - לְהָכִי אִיצְטְרִיךְ קְרָא מְיוּתָּר - for that [very] purpose [it makes sense to say that] the extra pasuk is necessary, לוֹמַר דְחַיְיל עַלֵיה נְזִירוּת - to tell [us] that [in fact] the [new status of] being a nazir "rests upon him" [i.e. it becomes applicable (despite the above)]! וְעוֹד קָשֶׁה - In addition, it is difficult: מַאי מְשַׁנִי בָּתָר הָכִי - What is [the Gemara] answering afterwards - כְּגוֹן שֶׁנִשְׁבַּע לִשְׁתּוֹת וְחָזַר וְנָדַר בְּנָזִיר - [by substituting] a case where someone swore to drink and [then] proceeded to declare himself a nazir - דְאַתְיָא נְזִירוּת וְחַיְיל אַשְׁבוּעָה - "for [then] the status of being a nazir comes and rests upon the shevu'ah oath"? - מִכָּל מָקוֹם תִּקְשִׁי לוֹ - nevertheless [the Gemara] should [still] have the objection - הַרֵי מוּשְׁבַּע וְעוֹמֵד מֵהַר סִינַי - "[but then] he already stands sworn from Mount Sinai" - כְּלוֹמַר דְאֵין מוּשְׁבַּע וְעוֹמֵד גָדוֹל מִזֶה - (i.e.) for there is no [case of someone who] "stands sworn" greater than this [case] - שֶׁנִשְׁבַּע לִשְׁתּוֹת - where he [himself actually] swore to drink! וְעוֹד קָשֶׁה - In addition, it is difficult: דְקִדוּשׁ הַיוֹם לַאו דְאוֹרַיְיתָא הוּא - (For) [in our context] "the sanctification of the day" [i.e. kiddush] is not Torah mandated; דְנְהִי נַמִי דִכְתִיב "זָכוֹר" - for even granted that it is written "Remember [the Shabbos day]" - וְדַרְשִׁינָן "זוֹכְרֵהוּ עַל הַיַיִן" - and we derive [from that pasuk (in Pesachim 106a, as brought just above) the teaching] "Remember it over wine" - אַסְמַכְתָּא הוּא - [nevertheless in fact] that [derivation] is [only] an "asmachta" [i.e. a mere "clue"]. לָכֵן נִרְאֶה לְרַבֵּינוּ תַּם - Therefore, Rabbeinu Tamº holds - דְגַרְסִינָן בִּתְמִיהָ - that we [should] read [i.e. the correct version of the Gemara reads] as a [statement of] surprise: "וְכִי מוּשְׁבַּע וְעוֹמֵד מֵהַר סִינַי?" - "Does he [then] already stand sworn from Mount Sinai?", כְּלוֹמַר - meaning: לָמָה לִי קְרָא מְיוּתָּר לֶאֱסוֹר יַיִן מִצְוָה - Why is an extra pasuk necessary [in order] to [teach that] Mitzvah wine is assur, "וְכִי מוּשְׁבַּע" וְכוּלֵיה - "does he [then] already [stand] sworn" etc., דְנְהִי דְקִידוּשֵׁי הַיוֹם דְאוֹרַיְיתָא - because [after all - even] granted that "the sanctification of the day" [i.e. kiddush] is Torah-mandated - עַל הַיַיִן לַאו דְאוֹרַיְיתָא - [but saying it] over wine is Rabbinical, דְ"זוֹכְרֵהוּ עַל הַיַיִן" אַסְמַכְתָּא - for [the derivation] "Remember it over wine" is [only] an "asmachta" ["clue"]; וְהַשְׁתָּא מְשַׁנִי - and at this point [the Gemara] answers - כְּגוֹן שֶׁנִשְׁבַּע לִשְׁתּוֹת - [by substituting] a case where "someone swore" [etc.], וְקָא מַשְׁמַע לָן קְרָא יְתֵירָא - and [with that case we understand that] the [extra] pasuk teaches us - דְחַיְיל עַלֵיה אַף עַל גַב שֶׁנִשְׁבַּע לִשְׁתּוֹת - that the [status of being a nazir] "rests upon him" [i.e. becomes applicable] even though he swore to drink.
Shitah Mekubetzesº (ibid.), quoting "R' Azriel" (adding to the above "difficulties"): תֵּינַח קִידוּשׁ - [Even if] you grant [that] kiddush [is Torah mandated], אַבְדַלְתָּא מַאי אִיכָּא לְמֵימַר - what can be said [regarding] havdalah? וְעוֹד - Furthermore, אִי נַמִי קִדוּשָׁא מִן הַתּוֹרָה - even if kiddush is Torah-mandated [i.e. even that it be said over wine] - אֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לִטְעוֹם לְמְבָרֵךְ אֶלָא מִדְרַבָּנָן - there is [certainly] no need for "tasting" [i.e. partaking of the wine] by the one who said the bracha except Rabbinically; אִי נַמִי יִשְׁמַע מִפִּי אַחֵר שֶׁיִטְעוֹם - or [in fact - even to satisfy Rabbinical Halacha] - let him hear [kiddush] from another, who will [then] "taste", [ibid.] אוֹ יְקַדֵשׁ וְיִתֵּן הַכּוֹס לְאֶחָד מִבְּנֵי בֵּיתוֹ - or let him [i.e. the nazir himself] say kiddush and give the cup to one of the members of his household [to "taste"]; וְעוֹד - and moreover, אַפִילוּ מִדְרַבָּנָן אֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לִטְעוֹם רְבִיעִית - even Rabbinically there is no need to "taste" a [full amount of a] "revi'is" - אֶלָא מְלֹא לוּגְמָיו - [but rather] only [the amount called] "the fill of one's cheeks" - וְנָזִיר אֵינוֹ אָסוּר אֶלָא בְּרְבִיעִית - and only a "revi'is" is assur [for] a nazir!
Berachos 20b2: אָמַר רַב אַדָא בַּר אַהֲבָה - Rav Adda bar Ahavah said: נָשִׁים חַייָבוֹת בְּקִדוּשׁ הַיוֹם - Women are obligated in "sanctification of the day" [i.e. the Friday night kiddush (as seen above in se'if 1, from Pesachim 106a)] - דְבַר תּוֹרָה - by the word of the Torah [itself]. אַמַאי - Why? - מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁהַזְמַן גְרָמָא הוּא - it is [after all] a positive Mitzvah caused by time, וְכָל מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁהַזְמַן גְרָמָא - and [concerning] all positive Mitzvahs caused by time - נָשִׁים פְּטוּרוֹת - women are not obligated! אָמַר אַבַּיֵי - Abbaye said: מִדְרַבָּנָן - [The obligation is] Rabbinical. אָמַר לֵיה רָבָא - Rava said to him: וְהָא "דְבַר תּוֹרָה" קָאָמַר - [But] he said "by the word of the Torah"! - וְעוֹד - and furthermore, כָּל מִצְוַת עֲשֵֹה - [according to you, in the case of] all positive Mitzvahs [i.e. even those caused by time] - נְחַייְבִינְהוּ מִדְרַבָּנָן - let [the Halacha be to] obligate them Rabbinically! אֶלָא אָמַר רָבָא - Rather, Rava said: אָמַר קְרָא "זָכוֹר וְשָׁמוֹר" - The pasuk* says "Remember and Observe" [i.e. these two versions for starting the fourth of the Ten Commandments (Sh'mos 20:8 & Devarim 5:12) were in fact "spoken as one" (Shevu'os 20b) in order to link the two wordings so as to teach the following (Rashi ibid.)]; כָּל שֶׁיֶשְׁנוֹ בְּשְׁמִירָה - anyone who is [included] in [the Mitzvah of] "observing" [Shabbos by avoiding melacha*] - יֶשְׁנוֹ בְּזְכִירָה - is [included] in [the Mitzvah of] "remembering" [i.e. actively "commemorating" Shabbos - a.k.a. saying kiddush]; וְהַנִי נָשִׁי - and [consequently when it comes to] these [Jewish] women [of ours] - הוֹאִיל וְאִיתְנְהוּ בְּשְׁמִירָה - since they are [included] in "observing" [Shabbos (since avoiding melacha is of course a negative Mitzvah)] - אִיתְנְהוּ בְּזְכִירָה - they are [likewise included] in "remembering" [i.e. kiddush].
Berachos 20b3: אָמַר לֵיה רַבִינָא לְרָבָא - Ravina said to Rava: נָשִׁים בְּבִּרְכַּת הַמָזוֹן - [Is the obligation of] women in Birkas HaMazon - דְאוֹרַייְתָא אוֹ דְרַבָּנָן - Torah-mandated or Rabbinical? לְמַאי נַפְקָא מִינָה - (For) what is the [practical] outcome from it? לַאַפוּקֵי רַבִּים יְדֵי חוֹבָתָן - [Whether a woman is able] to "cause the many [who are gathered (i.e. including the men)] to be yotzei" their obligation, [since we reason as follows]: אִי אַמְרְתְּ (בִּשְׁלָמָא) דְאוֹרַייְתָא - If you say [women's obligation] is Torah-mandated, אָתִי דְאוֹרַייְתָא - [the woman who is obligated] by Torah mandate [can then] come - וּמַפִּיק דְאוֹרַייְתָא - and "cause [men who are obligated] by Torah mandate to be yotzei" [their obligation]. (אֶלָא אִי) [וְאִי] אַמְרְתְּ דְרַבָּנָן - [On the other hand,] if you say [women's obligation] is Rabbinical, הַוִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מְחוּייָב בַּדָבָר - [then] it is [a case of] someone who is not obligated in the matter [i.e. on the Torah-mandated level which does apply to the men's obligation], וְכָל שֶׁאֵינוֹ מְחוּייָב בַּדָבָר - and [in] any [case of] someone who is not obligated in the matter [in which others need to be yotzei an obligation] - אֵינוֹ מוֹצִיא אֶת הָרַבִּים יְדֵי חוֹבָתָן - he [i.e. that non-obligated "someone"] cannot "cause the many [i.e. those obligated 'others'] to be yotzei their obligation."
The Gemara (Pesachim 105a3): אָמַר לֵיה - He said to him [i.e. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said to Ravina]: [ibid.] מִי שֶׁלֹא קִידֵשׁ בְּעֶרֶב שַׁבָּת - [In the case of] someone who did not say kiddush on Friday evening, מְקַדֵשׁ וְהוֹלֵךְ כָּל הַיוֹם כּוּלוֹ - he continues [to be able (and therefore obligated)] to say it [any time] throughout the day [of Shabbos]. אֵיתֵיבֵיה - He [i.e. Ravina] challenged him [with the following Baraisa]: כָּבוֹד יוֹם וְכָּבוֹד לַיְלָה - [If one has to choose between] the honor of the [Shabbos] day [i.e. in matters of dining] and the honor of the night [before], כָּבוֹד יוֹם קוֹדֵם - the honor of the day takes precedence; וְאִם אֵין לוֹ אֶלָא כּוֹס אֶחָד - and if one only has [enough for] one cup - אוֹמֵר עָלָיו קִידוּשׁ הַיוֹם - he says [105b] "the sanctification of the day" [i.e. kiddush] over it, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁקִידוּשׁ הַיוֹם קוֹדֵם לְכָּבוֹד יוֹם (וְכָּבוֹד לַיְלָה) - because "the sanctification of the day" takes precedence [even] over the honor of the day (and the honor of the night); וְאִם אִיתָא - and if [your statement] is true, לִישְׁבְּקֵיהּ עַד לְמָחָר - [then if one only has enough for one cup] let him leave [that wine "unused"] until the next day - וְלִיעֶבִיד בֵּיהּ תַּרְתִּי - and let him [thereby] accomplish both [kiddush and "the honor of the day"]! אָמַר לֵיה - He [i.e. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak] said to him: חַבִיבָה מִצְוָה בְּשַׁעְתָּהּ - A Mitzvah done in its [proper] time is [especially] precious.Rashbamº (ibid.): אִם אֵין לוֹ יַיִן הַרְבֵּה לְסְעוּדָה אוֹ מִינֵי מְגָדִים - [The Baraisa's preference of day over night means that] If one does not have delicacies or extra wine [to use] for the meal [both times], יַנִיחֵם עַד הַיוֹם - he should leave them ["unused"] until the day [meal].
Tosafosº (ibid. 113a): וּמְפָרֵשׁ מוֹרִי הָרִ"י - (And) my teacher "the Ri" explains - דְקִידוּשׁ יוֹם קָרִי כִּיבּוּד יוֹם - that the kiddush of the day is "called" [by the Baraisa] "the honor of the day" [i.e. even this is outweighed by the Friday evening kiddush, and it goes without saying that drinking wine during the meal is outweighed by kiddush (Maharshaº)]; וְהָכִי אִיתָא בְּיְרוּשַׁלְמִי פֶּרֶק שְׁלֹשָׁה שֶׁאָכְלוּ - [After all,] that's what is [stated] in the Yerushalmi [of the] chapter "Three who ate" [i.e. the seventh of Brachos (56a)]: רַבִּי יוֹסִי בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי יַעֲקֹב בַּר רַבִּי אַדָא - R' Yose [said] in the name of R' Yaakov bar R' Adda: אֵיזֶהוּ כִּיבּוּד יוֹם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָפֶן - Which [matter] is [called] "the honor of the day"? - [the bracha of] "the Creator of the fruit of the vine" [i.e. "boray p'ri haGafen"].
Pesachim 106b1: אָמַר רַב הוּנָא אָמַר רַב - Rav Huna said in the name of Rav: טָעַם אֵינוֹ מְקַדֵשׁ - [If] one "tasted" [i.e. ate something (Rashbamº)] he [consequently] does not say kiddush [that night; rather, during the following day (he says kiddush) before his meal (Rashbam)]. [The Gemara shortly afterwards brings two more Amora'im (both quoting Shmuel), one agreeing with the above, and the other disagreeing.]  [ibid. 107a] אָמַר רָבָא - Rava said: הִילְכְתָא טָעַם מְקַדֵשׁ - The Halacha is [that if] one "tasted" - he [nevertheless] does say kiddush.
Pesachim 105a1: דְאָמַר רַב - (For) Rav said: כְּשֵׁם שֶׁהַשַׁבָּת קוֹבַעַת - Just as Shabbos "establishes" [itself] - לְמַעֲשֵׂר - with respect to ma'aser* [i.e. Shabbos meals are automatically considered a "fixed" manner of eating, and therefore it is assur to eat pre ma'aser produce even in a manner (normally) considered "momentary" (Rashbamº)]; כַּךְ שַׁבָּת קוֹבַעַת לְקִידוּשׁ - so [too] Shabbos "establishes" [itself] with respect to kiddush [i.e. beginning immediately at the onset of Shabbos at nightfall it becomes assur to "taste" (i.e. partake of food or drink) until kiddush is said (Beis Yosef, taken from Rashbam)].
The Gemara (Pesachim 100a2): דְתַנְיָא - (For) it was taught in a Baraisa: מַפְסִיקִין לְשַׁבָּתוֹת - one "interrupts" [his meal] at [the onset of] Shabbosim [i.e. if one was in the middle of a meal he must "uproot the table" - i.e. end the meal definitively (Rashbamº)], דִבְרֵי רַבִּי יְהוּדָה - [these are] the words of R' Yehudah, רַבִּי יוֹסִי אוֹמֵר - R' Yose says: אֵין מַפְסִיקִין - one does not "interrupt" [at all (Rashbamº)]; וּמַעֲשֶׂה בְּרַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַמְלִיאֵל [וְרַבִּי יְהוּדָה] וְרַבִּי יוֹסִי - and a story [occurred] with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and R' Yehudah and R' Yose: שֶׁהָיוּ מְסוּבִּין בְּעַכּוֹ - (that) they were reclining [i.e. to eat] in Acco, וְקִדֵשׁ עַלֵיהֶם הַיוֹם - and the [Shabbos] day became sanctified upon them [i.e. night fell]; אָמַר לוֹ רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַמְלִיאֵל לְרַבִּי יוֹסִי - Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said to R' Yose: "בְּרַבִּי - רְצוֹנְךָ נַפְסִיק וְנֵיחוּשׁ לְדִבְרֵי יְהוּדָה חַבֵירֵנוּ?" - "Master, is it your wish that we should 'interrupt' [our meal] (and act [thereby]) out of concern for the words of our colleague Yehudah?"; [ibid.] לֹא זָזוּ מִשָׁם עַד שֶׁקָבְעוּ הַלָכָה כְּרַבִּי יוֹסִי - They did not leave that place until they had established the Halacha as [following] R' Yose. אָמַר רַב יְהוּדָה אָמַר שְׁמוּאֵל - Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: אֵין הַלָכָה לֹא כְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה - The Halacha is not like R' Yehudah - וְלֹא כְּרַבִּי יוֹסִי - and [the Halacha] is not like R' Yose, אֶלָא פּוֹרֵס מַפָּה וּמְקַדֵשׁ - [but] rather, one spreads a cloth and says kiddush. [The Rashbam explains the purpose of "spreading a cloth": (a) like one always does - as in se'if 9 - and Shmuel's only chiddush is to say kiddush before eating and not afterwards (and Art. says that's because of the issur of the previous subject), or (b) to end the first meal (Art. brings that acc. to Rabbeinu Dovid he doesn't bentch then - but acc. to Maharsha he does -- so acc. to Halacha that he doesn't bentch, it seems we should prefer the Rashbam's explanation (a).)]
The Yerushalmi (Berachos 11a): הָא קְדוּשָׁה - What about [the bracha of] kiddush [which follows immediately after the bracha of wine and nevertheless begins with "Baruch..." ("Blessed is..."), contrary to the above-mentioned rule]! שַׁנְייָא הִיא - That [bracha] is exceptional, שֶׁאִם הָיָה יוֹשֵׁב וְשׁוֹתֶה מִבְּעוֹד יוֹם - for if [someone] was sitting and drinking from when it was still daytime [i.e. he was already in the middle of drinking wine] - וְקִדֵשׁ עָלָיו הַיוֹם - and "the day became sanctified" for him [i.e. night fell], שֶׁאֵינוֹ אוֹמֵר בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָפֶן - then [in the kiddush he says at that point] he does not say [the bracha of] "the Creator of the fruit of the vine" [i.e. "boray p'ri haGafen"] (i.e. and therefore the bracha of kiddush is not inherently "a bracha which follows immediately after another").
The Tosafosº to Pesachim 103a explains this Halacha (where one had been drinking): דְכָּל דְבַר מִצְוָה הַטָעוּן כּוֹס - For [in the case of] any Mitzvah matter which calls for a cup [of wine], אֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָפֶן - it is not necessary to [repeat] the bracha of "the Creator of the fruit of the vine" [i.e. "boray p'ri haGafen"] - הֵיכָא דְלֹא הַוִי הֶפְסֵק - [in cases] where [the Mitzvah matter] is not [considered] an interruption.
The Rifº (Pesachim, 19b of "his pages"): ...פּוֹרֵס מַפָּה וּמְקַדֵשׁ - ...One "spreads a cloth and says kiddush", וְאַחַר כַּךְ שָׁרִי הַמוֹצִיא - and afterwards he begins [his meal over again (Mishnah Berurah) with the bracha of] "Who brings forth [bread]" [i.e. "haMotzi"], וְגָמַר לְסְעוּדָתֵיהּ - and he completes his meal, וּמְבָרֵךְ בִּרְכַּת הַמָזוֹן - and [then] he says Birkas HaMazon.
Pesachim 103a? (and Chulin 86b?): אָמַר לֵיה אַנָא עַבְדִי כְּתַּלְמִידִי דְרַב - He said to him: "I acted in accordance with [the Halacha of] the students of Rav"; דְרַב בְּרוֹנָא וְרַב חַנַנְאֵל תַּלְמִידִי דְרַב הַווּ יַתְבִי בְּסְעוּדָתָא - for Rav Berona and Rav Chananel the students of Rav were [once] sitting at a meal, [103b] קָאִי עָלַייְהוּ רַב יֵיבָא סָבָא - [while] Rav Yeiva the Elder stood over them [i.e. waiting upon them]; אָמְרוּ לֵיה הַב לָן וְנִיבְרִיךְ - They said to him: "Bring us [wine] and let us 'be mevareich' [i.e. say the brachos of Birkas HaMazon]," לְסוֹף אָמְרוּ לֵיה הַב לָן וְנִישְׁתִּי - [and] subsequently they [reversed themselves (Chulin) and] said to him: "Bring us [wine] and let us drink," אָמַר לְהוּ הָכִי אָמַר רַב - [whereupon] he said to them: Rav said this [i.e. as follows]: כֵּיוָן דְאַמְרִיתוּ הַב לָן וְנִיבְרִיךְ - Once you have said "Bring us [wine] and let us 'be mevareich' [i.e. say the brachos of Birkas HaMazon]," אִיתְּסְרָא לְכוּ לְמִישְׁתִּי - it has become assur for you to drink; מַאי טַעֲמָא - What is the reason? דְאַסְחִיתוּ דַעֲתַּייְכוּ - Because you have "removed your minds" [i.e. shifted your focus (away from continuing the meal)].
The Shiltei HaGiborimº (note 15 to the Mordechaiº on Berachos): נִמְצָא בְּתְּשׁוּבַת הַגְאוֹנִים - In the responsa of the Gaonim is found [the following:] אָדָם שֶׁשָׁכַח מִלְקַדֵשׁ וּלְהַבְדִיל - [In the case of] a person who forgot to say kiddush (or havdalah), נָטַל יָדָיו לְאֲכִילָה - [and] he washed his hands [in order] to eat [bread] - וּבִּרֵךְ בִּרְכַּת הַמוֹצִיא - and he said the bracha of "haMotzi", וּלְאַחַר שֶׁבֵּרֵךְ עַל הַלֶחֶם - and after he said the bracha over bread - נִזְכַּר שֶׁלֹא קִידֵשׁ - he remembered that he had not said kiddush, יְקַדֵשׁ עַל הַפַּת - he should say kiddush over the bread; דְהָא אַמְרִינָן בְּעַרְבֵי פְּסָחִים - After all, it says in [the chapter] "Eves of Pesach" [i.e. the tenth of Pesachim (106b)]: נָטַל יָדָיו לֹא יְקַדֵשׁ - "[If] one washed his hands he should not say kiddush [over wine]", נִלְמוֹד אִם נָטַל יָדָיו - [and from this] we can learn [that] if one has washed his hands - הוּקְבַע קִידוּשׁ עַל הַפַּת - his kiddush has been established [as having to be said] over bread, [etc.]; אַבָל בְּהַבְדָלָה - but in [the case of] havdalah, שֶׁאֵין מַבְדִילִין עַל הַפַּת - [where the Halacha is] that one does not say havdalah over bread, וְשָׁכַח וְנָטַל יָדָיו וּבִּרֵךְ הַמוֹצִיא - (and) [if] one forgot and washed his hands and said the bracha of "haMotzi" - וְנִזְכַּר שֶׁלֹא הִבְדִיל - and [then] he remembered that he had not said havdalah, אַחַר בִּרְכַּת הַמוֹצִיא יֹאכַל הַמוֹצִיא - [then] after the bracha of "haMotzi" he should "eat haMotzi" [i.e. bread] – וְאַחַר כַּך יַבְדִיל - and say havdalah afterwards; דְהָא אָמַר רָבָא - After all, Rava said [Pesachim 107a]: טָעַם מַבְדִיל - [If] one "tasted" [i.e. ate something] he [still] says havdalah, טָעַם מְקַדֵשׁ - [and if] one "tasted" [i.e. ate something] he [still] says kiddush, [etc.]; הִלְכַּךְ טוֹב לוֹ - Therefore, it is better for him - שֶׁיֹאכַל הַמוֹצִיא - that he "eat haMotzi" [i.e. bread] - שֶׁלֹא יְבַטֵל בִּרְכַּת נְטִילַת יָדַיִם וּבִּרְכַּת הַמוֹצִיא - so that he will not render his bracha [over] washing [his] hands and his bracha of "haMotzi" null [i.e. unnecessary and inappropriate], שֶׁלֹא יָבֹא תַּקָנָה לָהֶם לְהַפְסָדָתוֹ - for no rectification of his causing them to be lost will be available for them, אַבָל לְהַבְדָלָה - whereas for the loss of [saying] havdalah [(or kiddush) first] - יֵשׁ לָהֶם תַּקָנָה אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאָכַל - for them there is a rectification even if one ate [i.e. as mentioned]. Note: Later in the same note we find: "(And) if one washed his hands before the cup [of wine] was brought to him [then] he should say kiddush over bread, as it says: [If] one washed his hands [then] he should not say kiddush [over wine]."

The Tosefta* in Brachos (5:4) [regarding the ruling of R' Yose]: כּוֹס רִאשׁוֹן מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בִּרְכַּת הַמָזוֹן - Over [the] first cup one says Birkas HaMazon, וּמַזְכִּיר שֶׁל שַׁבָּת בְּבִּרְכַּת הַמָזוֹן - and he makes mention of Shabbos in Birkas HaMazon, וּבַּשֵׁנִי (גירסת ליברמן - "וְהַשֵׁנִי") אוֹמֵר עָלָיו קְדוּשַׁת הַיוֹם - and over the second, one says "the sanctification of the day" [i.e. kiddush].

The Gemara (Pesachim 100b?): שֶׁאֵין מְבִיאִין אֶת הַשׁוּלְחָן - (That) the table is not brought [to those eating] - אֶלָא אִם כֵּן קִידֵשׁ - unless kiddush has [already] been said, וְאִם הֵבִיא - and if one did bring [the table before kiddush (Rashi)] - פּוֹרֵס מַפָּה וּמְקַדֵשׁ - [then] one spreads a cloth and [then] says kiddush.
Tosafosº (ibid.): וְהָא דְאָמַר בְּכָּל כִּתְבֵי - (And) [as for] that which it says in the chapter "All writings" [i.e. the sixteenth of Shabbos (119b)]: מָצָא שֻׁלְחָן עָרוּךְ - [If] one encountered a set table [when arriving home], מַלְאָךְ טוֹב אוֹמֵר (כוּלֵיה) - [the] good angel says: (etc.), לֹא קָשֶׁה - that is no difficulty, דְעָרוּךְ הוּא בְּמָקוֹם אַחֵר - for it may be set in [some] other place, אַךְ אֵין מְבִיאִין אוֹתוֹ לְמָקוֹם סְעוּדָה עַד אַחַר קִידוּשׁ - just that it is not brought to the location of the meal until after kiddush. וְעַכְשָׁיו - (And) [as for] nowadays, שֻׁלְחָנוֹת שֶׁלָנוּ שֶׁהֵם גְדוֹלִים יוֹתֵר מִדַאי - [regarding] our tables which are too large, וְקָשֶׁה לְהָבִיאֵם אַחַר קִידוּשׁ - and it [would be] problematic to bring them after kiddush, שֶׁלֹא לְהַפְסִיק כָּל כַּךְ בֵּין קִידוּשׁ לְסְעוּדָה - [due to the need] not to interrupt to such a degree between kiddush and the meal, אָנוּ רְגִילִין לִפְרוֹס מַפָּה וּלְקַדֵשׁ - we have the practice of spreading a cloth and saying kiddush; וְהַטַעַם מְפוּרָשׁ בְּשְׁאִילְתּוֹת - and the reason [for our Halacha] is explained in the [Gaonic] She'iltos: כִּי הֵיכִי דְתֵּיתִי סְעוּדָתָא בְּיְקָרָא דְשַׁבְּתָא - so that the meal [clearly] arrive as [a demonstration of] the honor of the Shabbos; וְיֵשׁ מְפָרֵשׁ זֵכֶר לְמָן - and there is [another authority who] expains [that the spreading is] a commemoration of the manna, שֶׁלֹא הָיָה יוֹרֵד בְּשַׁבָּתוֹת וְיָמִים טוֹבִים - which did not fall on Shabbosim and Yamim Tovim*, וְהָיָה טַל מִלְמַעְלָה וּמִלְמַטָה וְהַמָן בֵּינָתַיִם - and [whose formation also was such that] there was dew above and dew below and the manna [itself] in between.
